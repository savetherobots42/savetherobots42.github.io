            <h2>How to Run Scripts</h2>
            <p>Running PowerShell scripts is a straightforward process. Here are the steps to follow:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Open PowerShell:</strong> To open PowerShell, press the Windows key + R, then type
                    "powershell" and press Enter.</li>
                <li><strong>Set Execution Policy:</strong> By default, PowerShell only allows you to run signed scripts.
                    To run unsigned scripts, you'll need to set the execution policy to "RemoteSigned" or
                    "Unrestricted".
                    To do this, type "Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned" or "Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted" and press
                    Enter.</li>
                <li><strong>Change to Script Directory:</strong> Navigate to the directory where your script is located
                    by typing "cd path\to\directory" and pressing Enter. Alternatively, you can use the "cd" command to
                    change to the directory by typing "cd ." and pressing Tab to autocomplete the directory name.</li>
                <li><strong>Run the Script:</strong> To run the script, type "./scriptname.ps1" and press Enter. The
                    script will execute and output any results to the PowerShell console.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Here is a video tutorial demonstrating how to run a PowerShell script:</p>

                <iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w5FQLDTtycs" title="Peter R&#39;s Final Project" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>When you run the example script from the "Creating Scripts" page, it will create DHCP reservations, A
                records, and PTR records in DNS for the devices on your network. Here are examples of the output for
                each:</p>
            <h3>DHCP Reservations</h3>
            <p>The following image shows the DHCP reservations that were created by the example script:</p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="DCHP_output.png" alt="DHCP reservations output">
                <p class="caption">DHCP reservations output</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Forward Lookup Zone</h3>
            <p>The following image shows the forward lookup zone in DNS, with all of the new A records that were created
                by the example script:</p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="forward_output.png" alt="Forward lookup zone output">
                <p class="caption">Forward lookup zone output</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Reverse Lookup Zone</h3>
            <p>The following image shows the reverse lookup zone in DNS, with all of the new PTR records that were
                created by the example script:</p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="ptr_output.png" alt="Reverse lookup zone output">
                <p class="caption">Reverse lookup zone output</p>
            </div>
            <p>By running the script and examining the output, you can ensure that the DHCP reservations, A records, and
                PTR records were created correctly, and troubleshoot any issues that may arise. The example script can
                be modified to suit your specific needs, such as adding or removing DHCP reservations or modifying DNS
                records.</p>
            <p>Additionally, you can modify the example script to create other types of DNS records, such as MX records
                for email servers, or SRV records for domain controllers.</p>
            <p>Overall, using PowerShell scripts to manage your network infrastructure can save time and reduce errors.
                By automating repetitive tasks and ensuring consistency across devices, you can improve the reliability
                and security of your network.</p>
