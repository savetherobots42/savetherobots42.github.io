            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Congratulations! You have completed our how-to guide on managing DNS and DHCP using PowerShell. We hope
                that you found this guide helpful and informative, and that it has given you the confidence to manage
                your own DNS and DHCP infrastructure.</p>

            <p>As we conclude this guide, we leave you with a few memes related to DNS and DHCP:</p>

            <div class="center">
                <img src="star_meme.jpg"
                    alt="Darth Vader force choking someone and saying 'I find your lack of active directory disturbing'"
                    width="400" height="400" />
                <p class="caption">When your Active Directory is acting up and you have to take matters into your own
                    hands.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="center">
                <img src="SP-meme.jpg"
                    alt="A skier in South Park saying 'If Active Directory is unhealthy or DNS is unconfigured...you're gonna have a bad time...'"
                    width="400" height="400" />
                <p class="caption">When you thought you configured DNS correctly, but the errors keep rolling in.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Thank you for taking the time to read our guide. We hope that you found it helpful and entertaining.
                Happy
                DNS-ing and DHCP-ing!</p>
