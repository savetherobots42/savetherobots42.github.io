            <h2>Creating Scripts</h2>
            <p>In this section, we'll cover how to create scripts to automate the process of adding DNS, DHCP, and PTR
                records to your network. While it's possible to manually add records to your servers, creating scripts
                can save you time and reduce the risk of errors caused by manual entry.</p>

            <p>The following example script demonstrates how to create static records for multiple devices by iterating
                through a range of IP addresses and creating DHCP reservations, A records, and PTR records for each
                device. The script is written in PowerShell and uses cmdlets to interact with the DNS and DHCP servers.

            <div id="script-image">

             </div>
            <p>The script creates static records for multiple devices by iterating through a range of IP addresses and
                creating DHCP reservations, A records, and PTR records for each device. It uses PowerShell cmdlets to
                interact with the DNS and DHCP servers. Here's a brief explanation of what the script does:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Line 1-3:</strong> Sets the variables for the DHCP and DNS server IP addresses and the DHCP
                    scope to use.</li>
                <li><strong>Line 5-16:</strong> Creates a DHCP reservation, A record, and PTR record for each device in
                    the range of IP addresses specified in the for loop.</li>
                <li><strong>Line 6-11:</strong> Sets the hostname, IP address, and MAC address for each device.</li>
                <li><strong>Line 13:</strong> Adds a DHCP reservation for the device.</li>
                <li><strong>Line 16:</strong> Creates an A record in DNS for the device.</li>
                <li><strong>Line 19-22:</strong> Creates a PTR record in DNS for the device. The $ReverseZone variable
                    is
                    used to set the reverse lookup zone, which is based on the subnet of the IP address range. The
                    PtrDomainName parameter is set to the FQDN of the device.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>By using a script like this, you can create static records for multiple devices quickly and efficiently,
                saving time and ensuring consistency across your network. You can modify the script to suit your needs,
                such as changing the range of IP addresses or adding additional parameters for DNS or DHCP options.</p>
