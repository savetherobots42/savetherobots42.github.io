            <h2>Creating Static Records</h2>
            <p>Static records are manually assigned IP addresses and associated DNS records that do not change over
                time. While dynamic records can be automatically updated through the DHCP server, static records provide
                a consistent and unchanging reference to a specific network device or service. There are several reasons
                why you might need to create static records, including:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Network Infrastructure:</strong> Devices such as routers, switches, and servers typically
                    require static IP addresses to ensure they are always reachable and available for other devices on
                    the network.</li>
                <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> By assigning a static IP address and DNS record to a device, you can
                    ensure that other devices and services can always locate and communicate with it. This is
                    particularly important for devices that provide critical network services, such as domain
                    controllers, mail servers, and file servers.</li>
                <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Assigning static IP addresses to specific devices can make it
                    easier to manage and enforce access control policies, as you can reliably identify devices based on
                    their IP addresses.</li>
                <li><strong>IP Address Management:</strong> Using static records allows you to reserve a block of IP
                    addresses for specific devices, making it easier to manage IP address allocation and avoid address
                    conflicts.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To create static records, you will typically use the management interfaces of your DNS and DHCP servers.
                The exact process may vary depending on the server software you are using. In this website, we will go
                through the steps of automating the process of creating static records using scripts. By following the
                steps outlined in this website, you can create your own scripts to automate the process of creating
                static records, ensuring a consistent and well-organized network infrastructure.</p>
