            <h2>Setting Up Environment</h2>
            <p>Before you can create and run scripts to automate the management of DNS, DHCP, and PTR records, you need
                to set up your working environment. This includes installing the necessary tools, configuring your DNS
                and DHCP servers, and ensuring that your system meets the prerequisites for script execution.</p>

            <p>Follow these steps to set up your environment:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Install PowerShell:</strong> Ensure you have PowerShell installed on your system, as we'll
                    be using PowerShell scripts for automation. PowerShell comes pre-installed on most modern Windows
                    systems. You can also install PowerShell on other platforms like macOS and Linux. For installation
                    instructions, visit the <a
                        href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell">official
                        PowerShell documentation</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Configure DNS and DHCP Servers:</strong> Make sure your DNS and DHCP servers are properly
                    set up and configured. Depending on your server software,
                    the configuration process may vary. Consult the documentation for your specific software for
                    detailed setup instructions.</li>
                <li><strong>Enable Remote Management:</strong> To execute scripts remotely, ensure that remote
                    management is enabled on your DNS and DHCP servers. This typically involves allowing PowerShell
                    remoting and configuring the appropriate firewall rules.</li>
                <li><strong>Check Prerequisites:</strong> Some scripts may require additional PowerShell modules or
                    system configurations. Ensure that all prerequisites are met before running the scripts. This
                    includes installing the necessary PowerShell modules, configuring your system's execution policy,
                    and ensuring that your user account has the appropriate permissions to execute the scripts.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Once you have set up your environment, you are ready to create and run scripts for automating the
                management of DNS, DHCP, and PTR records. In the following sections, we will walk you through the
                process of creating and running your own custom scripts to manage your network infrastructure
                efficiently.</p>
