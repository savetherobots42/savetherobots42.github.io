            <h2>DNS, DHCP, and PTR Records</h2>
            <p>This page provides an overview of DNS, DHCP, and PTR records and their importance in a network
                environment. Understanding these concepts is crucial for managing and automating the addition and
                modification of records using scripts.</p>
            <h3>DNS Records</h3>
            <p>Domain Name System (DNS) is a system used to translate human-readable domain names (e.g.,
                www.example.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1). DNS records are entries in a DNS database that
                store information about domain names and their corresponding IP addresses, as well as other data. There
                are several types of DNS records, such as A (Address) records, CNAME (Canonical Name) records, and MX
                (Mail Exchange) records, each serving a specific purpose.</p>
            <h3>DHCP Records</h3>
            <p>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network protocol that assigns IP addresses and other
                network configuration information to devices automatically. DHCP records are entries in a DHCP server
                that store information about IP address leases and reservations for devices on the network. This helps
                maintain an organized IP address allocation system and avoids IP address conflicts.</p>
            <h3>PTR Records</h3>
            <p>Pointer (PTR) records are a type of DNS record that enables reverse DNS lookups. Reverse DNS lookups are
                the process of resolving an IP address back to a domain name. PTR records are particularly useful for
                email servers to verify the authenticity of the sender's domain and help reduce spam.</p>
