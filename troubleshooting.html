            <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
            <p>If you encounter any issues while following the steps in this how-to guide, try the following
                troubleshooting tips:</p>

            <h3>Problem: Script does not run</h3>
            <p>If you get an error message when running the script, double-check that the script file name and
                directory path are correct. Make sure that the script file has a .ps1 extension and that PowerShell
                execution policy is set to "RemoteSigned" or "Unrestricted".</p>

            <h3>Problem: DHCP reservation not created</h3>
            <p>If the DHCP reservation is not created, make sure that the DHCP server and scope IDs are correct. Also,
                check that the IP address and MAC address of the device being reserved are accurate.</p>

            <h3>Problem: DNS record not created</h3>
            <p>If the DNS record is not created, make sure that the DNS server and zone name are correct. Also, check
                that the hostname and IP address being used are accurate.</p>

            <h3>Problem: PTR record not created</h3>
            <p>If the PTR record is not created, make sure that the DNS server and reverse lookup zone name are
                correct. Also, check that the IP address being used matches the IP address of the A record in the
                forward lookup zone.</p>
