            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to this How-To Website on creating and managing DNS, DHCP, and PTR records using scripts. This
                project aims to demonstrate the process of automating the addition of records in a controlled
                environment. It will cover the concepts of DNS, DHCP, and PTR records, the reasons for creating static
                records, and provide a step-by-step guide on setting up your environment, creating scripts, and running
                them. Additionally, it will address troubleshooting issues that may arise during the process.</p>

            <p>As network administrators, it's essential to maintain an organized and secure infrastructure. Automating
                the process of adding and managing records can save time, minimize human errors, and ensure consistency
                across your network. By following the instructions and examples provided in this website, you'll be able
                to create, modify, and manage DNS, DHCP, and PTR records efficiently using scripts.</p>

            <p>Throughout this website, you will find information on:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The concepts and purposes of DNS, DHCP, and PTR records</li>
                <li>The importance of creating static records and their use cases</li>
                <li>Setting up your environment for script development and execution</li>
                <li>Creating scripts to automate DNS, DHCP, and PTR records management</li>
                <li>Running scripts and understanding the results</li>
                <li>Troubleshooting common issues and finding solutions</li>
                <li>A conclusion summarizing the benefits of using scripts for managing records</li>
            </ol>

            <p>By the end of this project, you will gain valuable knowledge and skills to automate the process of
                managing records in your network environment, making your job as a network administrator more efficient
                and streamlined. Happy learning!</p>
